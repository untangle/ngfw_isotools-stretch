# The GCE Linux guest environment currently comes from Google Cloud
# repositories and includes the necessary scripts and daemons to properly
# integrate with GCE. The following packages are installed to satisfy the
# default GCE end user experience. The Linux guest environment includes python2
# and python3 libraries which some users depend on. We therefore install both
# packages until python2 support is officially ended. Documentation and source
# is maintained in the following github repo.
