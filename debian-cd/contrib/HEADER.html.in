<h1>What's in this directory?</h1>

#ifdef STYLElist

   <p>These are list files.</p>

   <h2>How do I use these files?</h2>

   <p>
   The list files here simply describe what files are contained in
   each Debian ISO image, in order to help users find which images
   they might want to download. They are simply text files, compressed
   to save space and download time.</p>

#else
#  ifdef ARCHsource

     <p>These are files containing source code for the Debian
     operating system.</p>

#  else

     <p>These are files containing the installer and other software
     for the Debian GNU/KERNEL operating system.

#    ifdef ARCHmulti

       The files in this directory are designed to work on both 32-bit
       and 64-bit PCs (i386 and amd64).

#    else

       The files in this directory are specifically for
       the <code>ARCH</code> architecture.</p>

#    endif
#  endif

   <h2>How do I use these files?</h2>

#  ifdef STYLEjigdo

     <p>The files here are in "jigdo"
     format. Use <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>
     tools to download the contents of the complete ISO image files
     from what's here and a normal Debian mirror. You should end up
     with an exact copy of each ISO image as though you'd downloaded
     it directly via HTTP or FTP.</p>

#  elif defined(STYLEbt)

     <p>The files here are bittorrent files. Use
     a <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/torrent-cd/">bittorrent</a>
     client program to download the contents of the complete ISO image
     files in a peer-to-peer manner. You should end up with an exact
     copy of each ISO image as though you'd downloaded it directly via
     HTTP or FTP.</p>

#  elif defined(STYLEiso)

     <p>The files here are complete ISO images, ready to use.</p>

#  endif

   <p> Once you have downloaded all the ISO images you want, you will
   typically need to write them to installation media.</p>

   <h2>What size and type of media will I need?</h2>

   <p>The images described here are sized to be written to

#  ifdef TYPEcd
     writeable CD media
#  elif TYPEdvd
     writeable DVD media
#  elif TYPEbd
     writeable Blu-Ray media
#  elif TYPEdlbd
     writeable dual-layer Blu-Ray media
#  endif

   at a minimum, but may be written to larger media if needed.

#  ifdef ISOHYBRID

     For <strong>extra</strong> convenience, these images may also be
     written directly to a USB stick. So long as your computer will
     boot directly from that USB stick, it should start the Debian
     installer that way.

#    if defined(TYPEdvd)

       The first DVD in this set is also deliberately limited in size
       so it should fit on a standard-sized 4GB USB stick.

     <h2>There are lots of files here! Do I need all of them?</h2>

     <p>In most cases it is not necessary to download and
     use <strong>all</strong> of these images to be able to install
     Debian on your computer. Debian comes with a massive set of
     software packages, hence why it takes so many disks for a
     complete set. Most typical users only need a small subset of
     those software packages.</p>

     <p>Initially, you will only need to download and use
     the <strong>first</strong> image of a set (labelled as
     <code>debian-<i>something</i>-1</code> to be able to start the
     Debian installer and set up Debian on your computer. If there are
     more images available here
     (labelled <code>debian-<i>something</i>-2</code>,
     <code>debian-<i>something</i>-3</code>, etc.), they contain the
     extra packages that can be installed on a Debian system (as
     mentioned previously). They will <strong>not</strong> be bootable
     and are entirely optional. If you have a fast Internet
     connection, you're most likely better off installing any desired
     extra packages directly from the Debian mirrors on the Internet
     instead of by using these extra images.</p>

#  endif

#  if defined(TYPEcd) && !defined(ARCHsource) && !defined(STYLElist)
#    if !defined(ONEonly)

       <p>There are different versions of CD #1 here to allow for a
       choice of default desktop on installation,
       e.g. <code>debian-<i>something</i>-kde-CD-1</code> contains the
       core pieces of the KDE desktop and will default to installing
       that desktop when used. The <strong>default</strong> desktop
       installed using
       <code>debian-<i>something</i>-CD-1</code> is Gnome.</p>

#    endif

     <p>The <code>netinst</code> CD here is a small CD image that
     contains just the core Debian installer code and a small core set
     of text-mode programs (known as "standard" in Debian). To install
     a desktop or other common software, you'll also need either an
     Internet connection or some other Debian CD/DVD images.</p>

#  endif

#  ifdef UPDATES

     <p>The <code>update</code> files here are extra convenience files
     for people updating from previous versions of Debian. If you are
     installing fresh, you may safely ignore
     them. <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/#update-cd">More
     details...</a></p>

#  endif

   <h2>How can I verify my download is correct and exactly what has
   been created by Debian?</h2>

   <p>There are files here (MD5SUMS, SHA1SUMS, etc.) which contain
   checksums of the images. These checksum files are also signed - see
   MD5SUMS.sign, SHA1SUMS.sign, etc. Once you've downloaded an image,
   you can check:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>that its checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; and
      <li>that the checksum file has not been tampered with.
   </ul>

   <p>For more information about how to do these steps, read
   the <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/verify">verification guide</a>.
